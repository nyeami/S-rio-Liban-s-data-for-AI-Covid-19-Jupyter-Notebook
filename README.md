Covid-19 was first discovered and identified in November of 2019 in Wuhan, China where there were groups of patients experiencing flu-like symptoms from an unknown cause. This would later on in early 2020 be declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization(WHO). 
	Brazil was one of the many countries heavily impacted by the pandemic. By May of 2021 they had over 16 million confirmed cases and nearly half a million deaths. These numbers according to the “John Hopkins Research Center” have risen to almost 40 million cases and nearly one million deaths.
	Having large numbers of patients requiring care has put a lot of strain on hospitals. The objective for this project is to develop a model that will predict what patients need ICU admission.
